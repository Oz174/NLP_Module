What are the steps for a Naive Classifier for spam/ham emails 

After reading into a pandas data frame , here are the steps (I will write it three times)

What we need :  1) CountVectorizer from sklearn feature extraction (Or manually by Counter from collections)
		2) MultiNomialNB from sklearn naive bayes 
		3) Metrics from sklearn metrics , precision , recall , accuracy , f1_score 
		4) train_test split from sklearn model selection 

Steps :

1) Train test split the data 
2) fit_Transform the training data in the count vectorizer , but don't do with test data 
(We use fit_transform() on the train data so that we learn the parameters of scaling on the train data and in the same time we scale the train data. We only use transform() on the test data because we use the scaling paramaters learned on the train data to scale the test data)

3) the model of Naive bayes should fit on x_train and y_train , and then predict for x_test 
4) generate results
