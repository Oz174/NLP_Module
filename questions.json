      "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
      "model_answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns to memorize the training data instead of generalizing, leading to poor performance on new data.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of cross-validation in model evaluation?",
      "model_answer": "Cross-validation helps assess a model's performance by splitting the data into multiple subsets for training and testing, reducing the risk of overfitting.",

    "Q5": {
      "question": "What is regularization in machine learning, and why is it used?",
      "model_answer": "Regularization adds a penalty term to the model's cost function to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models.",
